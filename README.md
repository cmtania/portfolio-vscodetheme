# Portfolio - Created a web app portfolio based on coding syntax.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.4.

# I use Angular 12 with bootstrap 5.

It's still work in progress.

Live demo here: [Christian's Portfolio - Angular]( https://cmtania.github.io/portfolio-vscodetheme/)


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Open for improvement for my vs code theme portfolio. Thanks!
